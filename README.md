# RemoteDashboard
This is a graphical user interface designed to display the primary data of a racing car while it is in operation. In the actual application, there are two Xbee modules - one located in the car, and the other outside the car where an individual is connected to it via a USB port. This individual must have a script that reads the data transmitted through the Xbee module, and opens a socket through which all the data can be sent to be visualized by others. The RemoteDashboard connects to this socket, and obtains all the relevant information to be displayed on the screen. In order to demonstrate how it functions, there is a Python script called "DataSimulation.py" that generates random data and transmits it through port number 5005.

The dashboard project was my first project with C# that I worked on in 2020. At the time, I was not yet familiar with all the best practices and tools offered by the .NET framework, such as await/async, LINQ, and other features. However, I was able to complete the project and gain valuable experience with C# programming. As this project will be included in my Github portfolio, I have since taken the time to further develop my skills and knowledge of the .NET framework in order to improve the quality of my work. Overall, this project served as a great starting point for me to learn and grow as a C# developer.
